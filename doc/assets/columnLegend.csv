<Sample>__XIC,Columns with intensities as calculated by Metaboseek,"Get Intensities, xcms script, ",
<Sample>,Columns with intensities as reported by xcms,xcms script,xcms::groupChromPeaks
<IntensityColumn>__norm,"Normalized intensity values for an intensity column, typically named <Sample>__norm or <Sample>__XIC__norm; by default : (1) replaces zeros by lowest value in entire intensity dataset (assuming it represents the detection limit), (2) intensity values of each column are adjusted so that each column has the mean intensity equal to the mean intensity of the entire dataset.",Normalize data,FTNormalize
